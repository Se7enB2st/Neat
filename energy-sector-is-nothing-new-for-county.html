        <p>
          <span>
          Beaver County’s proud history in industry and manufacturing got shelved with the demise of the steel industry, but the energy sector that took root here in the 1950s is only expected to keep growing.
        </span>
        </P>

        <P>
          <span>
          The cornerstone of the county’s claim to energy is, of course, the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, which began generating electricity in December 1957 and is considered to be the birthplace of commercial nuclear power.
          Its development followed President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “Atoms for Peace” speech to the United Nations in 1953, in which he pressed for peaceful uses of atomic energy.
        </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
          Duquesne Light Co. submitted a partnership proposal that was accepted by the federal government. Groundbreaking occurred along the Ohio River on Sept. 6, 1954,
          when Eisenhower waved a radioactive wand in a Denver television studio and remotely started a shovel in Shippingport.
        </span>
        </P>
        <p>
          <span>
          The plant’s reactor started operating on Dec. 2, 1957, and electrical power was produced 16 days later. Over its 25-year life, the atomic plant produced more than 7 billion kilowatt-hours of power, according to a Duquesne fact sheet from May 1983.
        </span>
        </P>
        <p>
          <span>
          Even in death, the plant made history as it was the first nuclear power plant to be decommissioned. Operations ceased on Oct. 1, 1982, and work to dismantle the plant started about three years later.
        </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
          In December 1988, the reactor pressure vessel was removed from the containment building, and a few months later it was shipped to a burial site in Hanford, Wash. Cleanup at the plant site was estimated in 1985 to be $98 million, or about $215 million in today’s dollars.
        </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
          That legacy continues to this day with the FirstEnergy Corp.-owned Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station, which had Unit 1 reactor go online in 1976 followed by Unit 2 in 1987. Employing about 1,000 workers,
          the nuclear power plant pays about $4 million in local and state taxes, the company said.
        </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
          FirstEnergy assumed control of both the nuclear plant and the nearby Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in December 1999 when a deal with Duquesne Light was completed.
        </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
          Under that agreement, FirstEnergy received Duquesne Light’s stake in the two plants as well as three other power plants in Ohio in exchange for three Ohio coal-fired plants.
        </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
          Originally licensed to operate for 40 years each, Beaver Valley’s units received license renewals in 2009 from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Now, Unit 1’s license expires in 2036 and Unit 2’s in 2047.
        </span>
        </P>
        <p>
          <span>
          Most recently, FirstEnergy unveiled the first building that is part of a $30 million above-ground, dry-storage facility for spent fuel rods. The pad for the facility is on the site where the Shippingport Atomic Power Station once stood.
        </span>
          <p/>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Marcellus Money</strong></span>
          <p>
            <span>
          In the last few years, the development of the Marcellus shale basin for natural gas has spurred optimism of a new energy windfall. Hopes are also high that Shell Chemicals will formally announce its construction of a $2.5 billion ethane cracker plant in Potter Township,
          a decision that county leaders say could trigger a manufacturing and industrial surge.
        </span>
            <p/>
            <p>
              <span>
          Beaver County and many of its municipalities have been reaping the financial benefits from drilling under the state’s Act 13. Since 2012, the county has received $863,000, said county chief of staff Vince LaValle.
        </span>
              <p/>
              <p>
                <span>
          Under state law, that money is designated for specific items, such as parks, recreation and roads.
          Over the same period, county municipalities have received a total of $412,000, according to state data.
          Two of the biggest beneficiaries of Act 13 fees have been South Beaver Township, which has received $127,500 since 2012, and Ohioville, which has received $116,000.
        </span>
                <p/>
                <p>
                  <span>
          LaValle also noted that the county recently signed a lease for drilling under county park land and received an upfront payment of $2.8 million in December with royalties to come.
          LaValle said commissioners are waiting to get clarification from the state on how that money can be used.
        </span>
                  <p/>
                  <p>
                    <span>
          As for the cracker plant, that would be the crown jewel in energy expansion not just for the county, but the northeast United States.
          By now the numbers are familiar to anyone who has been paying the slightest attention the last few years.
        </span>
                    <p/>
                    <p>
                      <span>
          There are estimated to be up to 10,000 construction jobs and about 400 full-time jobs created through the cracker plant, which will process ethane from natural gas to produce pellets used to make a slew of products, including tires and plastics.
        </span>
                      <p/>
                      <p>
                        <span>
          The Pittsburgh Regional Alliance has said that once the facility is in operation, the annual economic output from operations could reach $4.8 billion.
        </span>
                        <p/>
                        <p>
                          <span>
          While the state gave Shell a $1.65 billion tax credit and the plant would employ 200 employees fewer than the former Horsehead Corp. zinc plant,
          the cracker’s mere presence is expected to draw peripheral industries that supply or support the plant as well as use the pellets it would produce.
        </span>
                          <p/>
                          <p>
                            <span>
          Besides those companies, officials are anticipating an influx of service businesses, such as restaurants, and housing purchases as Shell and Shell-related workers move to the county.
        </span>
                            <p/>
                            <p>
                              <span>
          Already, Shell is paying for utility transmission lines to be moved and Route 18 upgrades. Hotels have sprung up in Center Township and one is going up near the Beaver County Airport in Chippewa Township,
          and the planned Weavertown Industrial Park could bring up to 350 jobs to its site just down Route 18 from the proposed cracker plant site.
